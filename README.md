## 🧩 About

This is an **Android application** that brings the paper-and-pencil *SOS* game to mobile devices. The game allows two players to take turns placing the letters **S** and **O** on a grid with the goal of creating the sequence **SOS** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to score points. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Unlike the traditional offline version played with pen and paper, this mobile version includes:

✔ Play against a **smart computer AI**  
✔ **Local multiplayer** (play with a friend on the same device)  
✔ Score tracking and turn-based gameplay  
✔ Simple and intuitive UI

## 🕹️ Gameplay Rules

The core rules mirror the classic SOS game: :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

1. The game is played on a square grid.
2. Players alternate placing either **S** or **O** in any empty cell.
3. The objective is to form the sequence **SOS** in a straight line — *horizontally, vertically, or diagonally*.
4. Each time a player creates an **SOS**, they score a point and get another turn.
5. When the grid is full, the player with the highest score wins.
